# KNN_and_Naive_Bayes

a) Specifying the question
 
Study 1
The objective of this study is to use the Titanic dataset and to accomplish the following:
i)Using the Titanic dataset, build a model that classifies whether or not the passengers on board the Titanic survived or did not survive.
To implement this, we will apply the following algorithim:
•	KNearest Neighbours(KNN)
ii)Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques.
iii)Compare the performance of the models and state your conclusion and Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers.

Study 2
 
The objective of this study is to use spambase dataset provided to accomplish the following:
i)Build a model that will predict if an email is spam or not spam.
To implement this, we will apply the following algorithims:
•	Naive Bayes classsfier
ii)Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques.
iii)Compare the performance of the models and state your conclusion and Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers.

 
b)Defining the Metrics for success
 
To meet the objective of the study we will create the above mentioned models and assess suitability of each of the tested models on their appropriateness to solve the given problem.
We will subject the evaluation to the assumptions of each model, the features that important to the model and compare performance based on metrics such as accuracy scores, confusion matrix and make our conlusion. We will aim at an accuracy of 80% and above.
 
c) Context 
•	Titanic dataset
RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, although Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight .
